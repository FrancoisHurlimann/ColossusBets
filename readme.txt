Question 5
The asymptotic complexity can be computed as a count of all elementary operations, or a count of all comparisons
Each folder may have a number of files and also a number of other folders. The function will need to recursively work its way down the tree until no more child nodes (folders) are found

Question 6
Due to the huge volume of file and folders I would implement a zip archiving tool. Depending on the size of the files, whole folders will be zipped up and returned, maybe even break the download into smaller zip files.
Implementing a tool with some sort of checksum which check the file and request a reload of the damaged archive.
